Kord.Fi is a hybrid decentralized finance protocol that brings the power of leveraged yield farming to Tezosâ€™s native liquidity baking contract. Kord.Fi allows Farmers who provide liquidity for tez/tzBTC pair access to affordable leverage obtained from Lenders. This boosts Farmer yields up to 4 times, while also providing attractive income on either tez or tzBTC to lenders. 

Kord.Fi is a professionally built and managed platform with a superior risk-management approach that has been validated by security audit. It allows Lenders to efficiently utilize their portfolios and Farmers to attain superior risk-adjusted returns on liquidity baking.
